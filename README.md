Darish Zone (AKA DZ) returns with his blazing Raspberry Pi 4 loaded image “THE RETRO MACHINE” – a heavy 512gb build with over 23,000 games and 50 systems! This has taken 11 solid months, with DZ and his “DZ Team” endlessly ploughing away at it ! Check out his first boot video here!



🔶FROM THE AUTHOR:
----------------------------------
The project contains stellar assets never seen elsewhere, that was thanks to the circle of trust that i gained over years and my loyal Discord knights. We worked hard to provide the crazy quality for what DZ images are known for. Ten release candidates! The result is a huge 512GB image funded by the community, for the community. That was a wild ride and i thank everyone that let it happens. This will be my last work as I’ve decided to retire from the scene, would not be better than this! Thank you very much for your patience, Retro Machine has arrived
